A Conversational Agent for Ordering Meals

A conversational agent is a computer program that communicates with the user in natural language, following a specific dialog structure to accomplish a tasks. Common examples are automatic phone systems for making reservations, purchasing, bank inquiries, or personal voice assistants such as Amazon Alexa or Apple Siri.

In this homework, we will use Python functions to create a conversational agent. Our conversational agent will be very simple with a limited vocabulary and a simplistic dialog structure. The goal of the agent will be to allow the user to order from an Italian restaurant serving pizza and salad. The dialog could look as follows (the text highlighted in bold is entered by the user):
